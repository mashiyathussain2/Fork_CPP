Given an array A containing 2*N+2 positive numbers, out of which 2*N numbers exist in pairs whereas the other two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4}
Output:
3 4 
Explanation:
3 and 4 occur exactly once.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 1
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 2}
Output:
1 3
Explanation:
1 3 occur exactly once.
```

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
