Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree 
where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1
```
