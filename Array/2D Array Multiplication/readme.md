### To multiply two matrices, the number of columns of first matrix should be equal to the number of rows to second matrix.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**
```
 0 <= n <= 30
 
 ```
