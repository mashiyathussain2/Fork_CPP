Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Uber:

Given a list of numbers, find if there exists a pythagorean triplet in 
that list. A pythagorean triplet is 3 variables a, b, c where a2 + b2 = c2

Example:

Input: [3, 5, 12, 5, 13]

Output: True

Here, 52 + 122 = 132.

def findPythagoreanTriplets(nums):

# Fill this in.

print findPythagoreanTriplets([3, 12, 5, 13])

# True
