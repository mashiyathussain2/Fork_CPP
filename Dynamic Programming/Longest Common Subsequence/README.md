#### Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

#### A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters
#### A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
