# *Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything*
A programmer might use the number 42 as a placeholder or default value in their code, as a reference to the answer from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Additionally, the problem statement "Write a program to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything" has been used as a classic example problem in programming competitions and exercises. This problem can be solved in any programming language, including C++.

# *Task*
use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

#### *Sample Input 1* 
>- 1 
>- 2 
>- 88 
>- 42 
>- 99

#### *Sample Output 1*
>-1
>-2
>-88
