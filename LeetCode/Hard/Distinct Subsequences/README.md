Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
```
